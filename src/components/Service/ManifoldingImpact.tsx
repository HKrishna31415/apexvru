        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Manifolding in VRU systems refers to the process of connecting multiple vapor sources to a single vapor recovery unit. This technique is crucial for optimizing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of vapor recovery operations, especially in facilities with numerous tanks or loading points.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          The primary impact of effective manifolding is the consolidation of vapor streams, which allows a single VRU to handle a larger volume of emissions. This leads to:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-4">
          <li>Increased efficiency in vapor recovery.</li>
          <li>Reduced capital expenditure by minimizing the number of VRUs required.</li>
          <li>Simplified maintenance and operation due to a centralized system.</li>
          <li>Enhanced environmental compliance by capturing more volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Proper design and implementation of manifolding systems are essential to prevent issues such as pressure imbalances, cross-contamination, and reduced recovery rates. Our expertise ensures your manifolding system is optimized for performance and compliance.
